## BMP Suite

Basic format tests:
Images from the BMP Suite - Version 2.8; 2023-11-28

The [BMP Suite](https://entropymine.com/jason/bmpsuite/bmpsuite/html/bmpsuite.html) image generator itself is GPL, and isn't included, nor did it have its code referenced. We do thank the author for the well-researched test suite, which we are free to include:

"Image files generated by this program are not covered by this license, and are in the public domain (except for the embedded ICC profiles)."

The files with embedded ICC profiles aren't part of Odin's test assets. We don't support BMP metadata.
We don't support all "possibly correct" images, and thus only ship a subset of these from the BMP Suite.
